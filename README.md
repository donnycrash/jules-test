# AI Micro Site Test

This is a test to see how well AI can generate an entire micro site—including layout, design, and written content—using only natural language instructions. The goal is to evaluate the capabilities of modern AI tools in automating web development tasks, from scaffolding a React/Vite project to producing production-ready UI components, copy, and deployment configuration.

Additionally, this project serves as a benchmark to compare the performance and usability of Google's new agent Jules against other AI coding assistants. By building a real-world site from scratch, we can assess strengths, weaknesses, and the overall developer experience provided by these tools.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
